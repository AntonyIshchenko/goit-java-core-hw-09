## TASK 1 - ArrayList  

Write your own class `MyArrayList` as analog to the `ArrayList` class from Java Library.
You can use only 1 Array to store the data. 

Methods to realize:
 - **add(Object value)** - adds element to the end
 - **remove(int index)** - removes the element with the specified index
 - **clear()** - clears the collection
 - **size()** - returns the size of the collection
 - **get(int index)** - returns the element by index

## TASK 2 - LinkedList
Write your own class `MyLinkedList` as analog to the `LinkedList` class.
You can't use Array. Every element must be a separate intermediary object (Node), that contains links to the previous and next element of collection ().

Methods to realize:
 - **add(Object value)** - adds element to the end
 - **remove(int index)** - removes the element with the specified index
 - **clear()** - clears the collection
 - **size()** - returns the size of the collection
 - **get(int index)** - returns the element by index

## TASK 3 - Queue
Write your own class `MyQueue` as analog to the `Queue` class, that will work according to the FIFO principle (first-in-first-out).
You can use Nodes or Array.

Methods to realize:
 - **add(Object value)** - adds element to the end
 - **clear()** - clears the collection
 - **size()** - returns the size of the collection
 - **peek()** - returns the first element from the queue
 - **poll()** - returns the first element from the queue and removes it from the collection

## TASK 4 - Stack
Write your own class `MyStack` as analog to the `Stack` class, that will work according to the LIFO principle (last-in-first-out).
You can use Nodes or Array.

Methods to realize:
 - **push(Object value)** - adds element to the end
 - **remove(int index)** - removes the element with the specified index
 - **clear()** - clears the collection
 - **size()** - returns the size of the collection
 - **peek()** - returns the first element from the stack
 - **pop()** - returns the first element from the stack and removes it from the collection

## TASK 5 - HashMap
Write your own class `MyHashMap` as analog to the `HashMap` class.
Must be done using a single-connected Node.
Cannot store two Nodes with the same keys.

Methods to realize:
 - **put(Object key, Object value)** - adds a key + value pair
 - **remove(Object key)** - removes a pair by key
 - **clear()** - clears the collection
 - **size()** - returns the size of the collection
 - **get(Object key)** - returns the value (Object value) by key
